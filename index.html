    A simple homepage design welcomes your audience to your site, tells them what you want them to do next, and allows them to explore your site in more depth.

    You can add complexity to a simple homepage design, but you don’t want to start with a cluttered mess and have to selectively prune it. Always begin with the basics.

    What do you need on your homepage? What will your audience expect? And which elements take priority?

    When you can answer those questions, you’ll have the information you need for better homepage design. In web design, homepage elements have very specific purposes.
