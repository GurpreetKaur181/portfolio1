     <h4>What Makes a Great Contact Us Page?</h4>
     

     <p>
        You know, the question of the best ‘Contact Us’ page is very subjective. We mean that what is awesome for you, may appear bad or even ugly for other people.

        It's better to take into account not your personal taste and preferences, but User Experience. Please remember that a good ‘Contact Us’ page should have the following things.
        
        It must be easily accessible from the home page. You should put the link to your "Contact Us" page on a prominent (expected) place on the website so that the users could easily find it.
